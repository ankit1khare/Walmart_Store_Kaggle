Practicing ML and stats using Kaggle contest: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/overview

Kaggle is a great way to experiments with real-world datasets and solve close to real-time problems. The solution doesn't involve much feature engineering but I've established a baseline model and then played with different ML techniques to see how far they could take the accuracy.
